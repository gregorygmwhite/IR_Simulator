"All data is 2010 data unless otherwise indicated. Countries receive scores on each indicator as a fractional rank (0=top rank, 1=lowest) relative to all countries for which data is available. The actual simple ranks per category are based on the mean fractional ranks on the 5 indicators per category (subject to maximum 2 missing values per category). The overall rank is based on the average of the category ranks.",,,,,,,,,,
"In case of equal overall ranks, the country with the lowest low score on any of the 7 categories gets pushed down.",,,,,,,,,,
